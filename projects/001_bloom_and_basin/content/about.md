## Our Story

**Section Headline:**
How Bloom & Basin Began

**Paragraph 1:**
Bloom & Basin was born from a simple belief: desert landscapes can be absolutely stunning when you work with nature, not against it. Founder Maria Santos grew up learning to garden from her grandmother in a small Phoenix yard filled with native plants and succulents. That early love of desert flora turned into a career, and after 15 years designing landscapes across the Phoenix metro, Maria wanted to create something different—a place that combined retail plant sales with expert landscape services, all centered around drought-tolerant, desert-adapted greenery.

**Paragraph 2:**
In 2022, Bloom & Basin opened its doors on 7th Street. The shop quickly became a go-to destination for plant lovers seeking species that actually thrive in Phoenix's heat and low rainfall. At the same time, our landscaping division grew as homeowners and businesses sought sustainable, beautiful outdoor spaces that conserve water and celebrate Arizona's natural environment.

**Paragraph 3:**
Today, we serve the Phoenix metro area with both retail plant sales and full-service landscaping. Whether you're shopping for a single succulent or planning a complete xeriscape transformation, our team brings the same passion, expertise, and commitment to helping you create spaces that flourish in the desert.

## Our Approach

**Section Headline:**
How We're Different

**Point 1 - No Cookie-Cutter Solutions:**
Every property is different, and so is every client. We take the time to understand your space, your goals, and your lifestyle before making recommendations.

**Point 2 - We Only Recommend What Works:**
If a plant or landscape feature won't thrive in Phoenix, we won't suggest it. We're honest about what works and what doesn't in our climate.

**Point 3 - Quality Over Volume:**
We'd rather do a few projects exceptionally well than rush through dozens. Our reputation is built on craftsmanship and attention to detail.

**Point 4 - Long-Term Relationships:**
We're not a one-and-done business. Many of our landscaping clients return for maintenance, and our retail customers know us by name. We value long-term relationships built on trust and expertise.
