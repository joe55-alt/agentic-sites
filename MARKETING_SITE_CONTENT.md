### Problem Section

**Section Header:** The Old Way Doesn't Work

**Content:**

Building a website shouldn't drain your budget or your patience.

Traditional agencies charge $5,000-$15,000 and take 6-12 weeks. DIY builders leave you stuck tweaking templates at midnight. Freelancers ghost you mid-project.

You need a website that works — without the hassle.

Agentic Sites uses specialized AI agents working together to build your complete website. Each agent handles a specific job — branding, content, design, SEO — coordinated by an orchestration system that delivers polished results fast.

**Three Pillars:**

**1. AI-Powered Speed**
What takes agencies weeks, our system completes in days. Multiple AI agents work in parallel to accelerate every phase.

**2. Professional Quality**
Not template garbage. Custom designs tailored to your business, your audience, and your goals. Every site is built to convert visitors into customers.

No surprise invoices. No scope creep. One clear price, delivered on time.
